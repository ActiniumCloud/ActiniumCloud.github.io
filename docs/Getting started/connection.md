# Why can't I connect to the server when it says it's running?

## The server has not yet finished starting up
The game server process is considered to be running when it starts, but this does not mean that the server has finished starting. For example, plugins or mods may not be loaded yet, and maps may not be created yet. At this point, you cannot connect to the game. 

## Misspelling of connection address

## Unable to connect due to Mod/plugin issues
Mod/plugin issue is not related to ActiniumCloud, please check it yourself.

## Line under DDOS attack
It is normal for game servers to be attacked. If your line is killed, ActiniumCloud will automatically assign you a new line and you need to wait for it to take effect, which usually takes a few minutes.
