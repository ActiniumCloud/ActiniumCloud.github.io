!!! danger "Notice"
  `We do not guarantee the availability of your server files after the one-month suspension-to-deletion period.`

If a server has not been running for more than a month, it will be automatically deleted. This is to free up computing resources for other servers. Deleting a server will remove all data including backups, databases and all other files associated with the server. If you'd like to download your servers data please back it up and download said backup as soon as possible. If required, we may be able to assist in recovery of your servers files if the one month period between server suspension and deletion has not passed. We also may keep long term backup of your server so even if your server has been deleted we may still be able to recover the files, due to this we heavily encourage you to open a ticket if you'd like your files back.
